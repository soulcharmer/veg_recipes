Wild garlic pesto/spread

1. put approx. 2 handfuls of washed and cut wild garlic leaves into a container (use ceramic knife if possible)
2. throw in one handful of walnuts and one small handful of sunflower seeds
3. add a pinch or two of raw ground Himalayan salt
4. add approx. 50 ml of virgin olive oil
5. blend into a fine paste - a simple stick blender should suffice but you might need to apply some pressure while ensuring the blender does not overheat
6. if needed, add some more oil and/or salt to match your tastes
7. store in fridge for no longer than a couple of weeks
