Guacamole (avocado dip)

0. prepare a ceramic knife for cutting the veggies
1. let your avocado ripen - can take up to a week from when you've bought it
2. cut avocado in half, remove the stone, scoop up the flesh and squash it
3. add one finely cut onion
4. add several pieces of crushed garlic
5. add some salt - preferably kala manak which adds an egg-like taste but does not salt very much
6. optionally add several finely cut pickled gherkins
7. add some lemon juice
